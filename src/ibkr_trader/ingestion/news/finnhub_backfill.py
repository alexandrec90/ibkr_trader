"""Finnhub company-news history backfill — a self-healing scheduled job.

Finnhub's free tier serves roughly one year of company news, but a request returns at most
~250 articles (observed plateau in our data), so one wide fetch silently truncates. This
module instead walks fixed windows *backwards* from the oldest stored article toward a
rolling floor (today − ``backfill_days``), splitting any window whose response looks capped.

Progress needs no state table: the cursor is ``min(published_at)`` per symbol, recomputed
from the database each run. A finished symbol costs zero requests once the rolling floor
passes its oldest article; an interrupted or budget-stopped run resumes where the stored data
ends. Known limitation: a mid-history gap (e.g. the regular poll down for weeks) is invisible
to the min-date cursor — the regular poll's 7-day overlap covers short outages.
